# old-versions-of-RiC-O

In this repository, ICA/EGAD stores the oldest versions of RiC-O, which we recommend not to use, and accompanying material when it exists. 

For now, you will find here versions of RiC-O prior to RiC-O 1.0.

Note that RiC-O 0.2 is currently also still available in the [RiC-O repository](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O).
